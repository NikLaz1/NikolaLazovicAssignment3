# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

1) Global Variables all sorted and placed at the top of the Script.
2) Password length parameters defined.
3) Using the "toUpperCase" method, we make sure that both Y+y and N+n are recognized as valid inputs in the prompts for specifying desired password parameters.
4) the generatePassword function creates a pool of acceptable characters based on the user inputs and sorts out which to chose from the available 4 types of characters.
5) The for loop on line 64, allows the script to run through allowed set of characters, based on what the user chose, and randomizes them, and finally generates a password.
6) The password is the displayed in the allotted card.
